# EVENT MANAGER

## General idea 

This project was born out of interest in controlling the Philips HUE 
lighting system. Later, the idea evolved to make a more generic and
configurable system. This led to developing the initial "Event Manager".

With this software, you can integrate MQTT devices, such as the Sonoff 
Wifi switch (custom hardware nessesary!) and the entire ecosystem of
Philips HUE devices.

The system allows you to connect **devices**, build **rules** based on the 
**events** that occur and execute custom **actions**.

Basically an implementation of the "if this, then that" principle.
